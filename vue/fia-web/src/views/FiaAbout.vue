        Fia is a language learning platform that allows you to learn through
        conversation. Using custom AI models, Fia analyzes your messages to
        search for any grammar mistakes you may have made, and when it spots one,
        it explains your mistake to you.

        Okay, and where do the flashcards come in?
      </div>

      <div class="indent-4 prose">
        After explaining your mistakes, Fia stores it in a database for you to
        review later. Using a spaced-repetition algorithm, Fia reminds you to
        review specific flashcards. This algorithm makes the best use of your
        time and effort by only asking you to review information just before your
        brain forgets it.

        Try it and find out! If you are an absolute beginner, you can practice
        expressing yourself and using the in-built translation helpers to help
        you out. If you already know your <span class="italic">dus</span> from
        your <span class="italic">de las</span>, then just have a conversation
        where you can learn new vocabulary and keep your accent fresh!
